# CiviProspect
## Is CiviProspect for me?
CiviProspect provides the core structure for creating/ managing/ converting the fundraising opportunities of an organisation. It can also be used to manage any monetary opportunities such as sales opportunities and event sponsorships.

#### Create prospects
CiviProspect inherits all the features from CiviCase. You are able to create prospects in the system with your designed prospect stages and relationships/ roles. Additionally, you can record prospect-specific information such as budgeted amount, prospect amount, probability, expected date and restriction code (if applicable).

#### Manage prospects
You are able to keep all of your prospect expectation up to date by updating the probability, amounts and dates. You also have a chance to update these information when you move a prospect from one stage to another.

When a prospect becomes successful, you can easily convert the prospect into a contribution/ pledge. The payment progress will be shown on the relevant prospect. You are able to view the linked contribution/ pledge from  each prospect.

#### Prospect reporting
Since CiviProspect is an extended part of CiviCase, all CiviCase reports in CiviCRM can be used to report on CiviProspect. Apart from these default reports in CiviCRM, we also integrated CiviProspect with the powerful [ Pivot Reports extension](https://civicrm.org/extensions/civicrm-pivot-reports). Install the extension and you can start create your own flexible prospect reports!
